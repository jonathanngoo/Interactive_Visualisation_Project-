              Whales are located within all oceans. <br />

            </p>
            <li>Temperate</li>
            <li>Equator</li>
            <li>Arctic</li>

            <li>Mating grounds</li>
            <p>
              Whale's who travel from cold to tropical areas <br />
              when transitioning between feeding and mating periods <br />
              tends to carry seasonal reproductive cycles and <br />
              gestation periods (n.d, 2023).

              The graph shows the number of whales killed from 1900 <br />
              to 2010 (OurWorldInData, 2023). X axis represents year <br />

          <h2>Explanation</h2>
          <p>
            Whales are part of the food chain and contributes to <br />
            marine life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Due to their size and aura, 6 out of 13 whales species <br />
            are endangered.

          <li>Japan</li>
          <li>Norway</li>
          <p>
            1,000 whales each year were killed due to commercial <br />
            purposes.
          </p>
          <p><b>Climate Change</b></p>
          <p>
            Oceans with rising temperatures and lack of sea ice within <br />
            Arctic and Antarctic impacts habitat and resource of <br />
            whales (WWF, 2023).

                <p>Commercial Whaling has been around since the ban on international trade of whale products.

                <p>Additionally, Climate Change impacts whales by increased temperatures on ocean and 
                  lack of sea ice in Antarctic and Arctic oceans. Meaning, whales will travel long
                  distances to find food (WWF, 2023).

                <h2>How can we solve <br/> this problem?</h2>
                <li>Track your carbon footprint
                  <p>By travelling less and reducing energy consumption, 
                    it allows whales to breathe oxygen within their environment.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>Use less plastics/no plastics
                  <p>Purchase recycled products from 
                    shops or online and switching to 
                    re-usable bags.
